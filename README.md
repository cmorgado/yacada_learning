**attention!** work in progress
## Token with a community build to distribution

The goal of this project is to provide a set of validators that can be customized 

A token creator will be able to sell its tokens to the public, and give the possibility of the buyers
The token itself will have the utility the creator has in his use case (being a game, metaverse, etc.)

The current example set the sale with fixed bag.


|ADA                |Yacada |% ADA to referrer|
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|200|1000|5%            |
|400|2040 |10%           |
|600|3090|15%|
|800|4160|20%|
|1000|5250|25%|

**example:** 
Buyer A gets the 1000ADA Bag -> 5250 Yacada and 25% of each referral
Buyer B buys Bag 800 and referres buyer A 
	-> 4160 YACADA + 20% of each referral  
	-> Buyer A receives 25% of Buyer B investe ADA = 200 ADA
